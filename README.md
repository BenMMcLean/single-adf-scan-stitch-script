# Single ADF Scan Stitch Script

Stitch together two ADF scans of a double sided document into a single document showing both sides.

## Instructions

1. Scan the front side of the double sided document
2. Flip the stack over *without resorting the pages*. It should be set up such that the back of the last page is scanned first.
3. Run `stitch-scan.sh` like: `./stitch-scan.sh front.pdf back.pdf combined.pdf`
